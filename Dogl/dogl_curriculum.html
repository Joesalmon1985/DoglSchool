          <h2>Curriculum</h2>
          <p> We are a team of teachers, all of whom teach across the Key Stages. We are assisted by two specialist Teaching Assistants and work closely with the Inclusion team in supporting students with additional needs in English.
          At Dogl School, the English Faculty offer popular and dynamic learning opportunities for all students to develop their creative reading and writing skills. Our aim is to enrich, inspire and develop a passion for language and literature that will stay with pupils for life. Often internal and national writing competitions are promoted from within the faculty and likewise there are regular reading challenges designed to promote a love of reading across the key stages. As well as this, staff work tirelessly to ensure all students excel and reach their potential in all aspects of their KS3, GCSE and post-16 courses. Intervention is common place, with teachers working closely to support students in improving their exam and coursework performance.</p>
          <p> We are very proud of our results with English Language GCSE hitting 81% in 2014 and 85% A*-C in 2015.  This summer we achieved 85% A*-C in English Language or Literature.  We continue to strive for excellence and are aiming for even better results in 2017 with the new specifications.</p>
          <p>Our students have opportunities to attend conferences, workshops and performances as well as participate in National Competitions. Recent trips have included visits to The Royal Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford, a performance at Poole's Lighthouse, A level Conferences, a theatre trip to London and a residential trip the Battlefields in Belgium.</p>
          <p> When students join us in Year 9 we work closely with our link schools to ensure a smooth transition and then we work to build the skills needed for the GCSE courses.  Year 9 is a preparatory year where students cover both English Language and English Literature within their 6 lessons a fortnight.  We cover texts such as Macbeth by Williams Shakespeare, an introduction to characterisation by Charles Dickens, A 20th Century novel, a selection of Poetry from the Literary Heritage and non-fiction extracts.  We also work to develop writing skills using a wide variety of purposes and audiences.
          <p> For further information please contact Head of Faculty, Ms Maria Salmon</p>
